# Bad-passwords-and-the-NIST-guidelines

Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a bad password.

In this project, taking a list of user passwords and, using publication 800-63B, code has been written that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.

Following are the libraries/packages/concepts used.\
